SOLUTION GRADING RUBRIC:

Grade the proposed solution based on these criteria and return the grade (A, B, or C) in your response:

**GRADE A SOLUTIONS** (Excellent - Highly Feasible & Valuable):
- AI/Automation Fit: Perfect use case for AI - clear patterns to learn, repetitive tasks, or data processing that AI excels at
- Technical Feasibility: Can be built with existing AI technologies, APIs, and tools without major breakthroughs
- Implementation Speed: MVP can be built in 2-6 months with a small team
- Competitive Advantage: Difficult for competitors to replicate due to data moats, network effects, or technical complexity
- Value Delivery: Provides 10x+ improvement over current solutions (speed, cost, accuracy, or convenience)
- Scalability: Solution becomes more valuable with more users/data, low marginal costs

**GRADE B SOLUTIONS** (Good - Moderately Feasible & Valuable):
- AI/Automation Fit: Good fit for AI but may require combining multiple technologies or some manual processes
- Technical Feasibility: Achievable with current tech but may require significant engineering effort or custom models
- Implementation Speed: MVP can be built in 6-12 months with moderate team size
- Competitive Advantage: Some barriers to entry but competitors could replicate with effort and investment
- Value Delivery: Provides 3-10x improvement over current solutions in key metrics
- Scalability: Solution scales well but may have some operational or technical constraints

**GRADE C SOLUTIONS** (Fair - Limited Feasibility):
- AI/Automation Fit: Marginal fit for AI - mostly replaces human tasks without clear AI advantage
- Technical Feasibility: Requires significant technical breakthroughs, expensive infrastructure, or unproven technologies
- Implementation Speed: MVP requires 12+ months or large team to build
- Competitive Advantage: Easy for competitors to replicate, no significant moats
- Value Delivery: Provides less than 3x improvement, mostly incremental benefits
- Scalability: Limited scalability due to high marginal costs or operational complexity

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**
- Does this solution leverage AI's core strengths (pattern recognition, data processing, automation)?
- Can this be built with existing technology and reasonable resources?
- Is there a clear path from MVP to scalable business?
- What prevents competitors from easily copying this solution?
- How much better is this than what customers currently use?

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
After describing the solution, evaluate it against this rubric and assign it a grade (A, B, or C). Include the grade and a brief justification focusing on the most important factors that determined the grade.
