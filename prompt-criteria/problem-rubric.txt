PROBLEM GRADING RUBRIC:

Grade the identified problem based on these criteria and return the grade (A, B, or C) in your response:

**GRADE A PROBLEMS** (Excellent - Highly Scalable & Detectable):
- Digital Detectability: Problem creates multiple, clear digital footprints that are easily scraped/monitored (job postings, support tickets, social media complaints, app reviews, website changes)
- Signal Strength: Very specific, unambiguous indicators (e.g., "posts job for DevOps engineer", "receives negative reviews mentioning 'slow loading'")
- Automation Potential: Can be detected with 90%+ accuracy using existing APIs/scraping tools
- Market Size: Affects thousands of businesses with clear willingness to pay $500+/month
- Urgency: Problem causes immediate business impact (lost revenue, compliance issues, operational downtime)
- Current Solutions: Expensive ($5K+), manual, or demonstrably ineffective

**GRADE B PROBLEMS** (Good - Moderately Scalable & Detectable):
- Digital Detectability: Problem leaves some digital traces but may require combining multiple signals
- Signal Strength: Reasonably clear indicators but may need interpretation (e.g., "hiring spike in customer service", "mentions integration challenges")
- Automation Potential: Can be detected with 70-90% accuracy, may require some manual validation
- Market Size: Affects hundreds of businesses willing to pay $100-500/month
- Urgency: Problem causes noticeable friction but not immediate crisis
- Current Solutions: Moderately expensive ($1-5K), time-consuming, or partially effective

**GRADE C PROBLEMS** (Fair - Limited Scalability):
- Digital Detectability: Minimal digital footprints, mostly requires manual research
- Signal Strength: Vague or indirect indicators that need significant interpretation
- Automation Potential: Less than 70% detection accuracy, heavily manual process required
- Market Size: Affects smaller number of businesses or low willingness to pay (<$100/month)
- Urgency: Nice-to-have problem without immediate consequences
- Current Solutions: Cheap, adequate existing solutions or DIY approaches work fine

**REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL GRADES:**
- Must be B2B focused (business problems, not consumer)
- Must have potential for AI/automation to improve current solutions
- Must be specific enough to build a focused solution around

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
After generating the business idea, evaluate the problem against this rubric and assign it a grade (A, B, or C). Include the grade and a brief justification in your response.
